      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
          \item Worked under the supervision of Prof.\ Stefano Forte in the \href{https://nnpdf.mi.infn.it}{NNPDF collaboration} 
          as a developer of the \href{https://github.com/NNPDF}{NNPDF code}.
          \item Developed techniques and computational programs applied to particle physics, that utilize artificial intelligence for 
          investigating the internal structure of the proton with high precision using experimental data collected at \href{https://home.cern}{CERN}.
          \item Published research results in various papers and presented them in conferences.
